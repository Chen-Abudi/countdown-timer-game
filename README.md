## 🧰 🛠️ Tech Stack & Techniques:

- React
- JavaScript
- CSS3
- Vite
- Use Ref + Forward Ref
- **React Hooks**: **`useImperativeHandle`** customizes the values exposed by a child component's imperative API, optimizing and controlling its external interface.

## State **`VS`** Refs:

| **`State`**                                                                              | **`Refs`**                                                                                                                      |
| :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **`-`** Causes component re-evaluation (re-execution) when changes.                      | **`-`** Do not cause component re-evaluation when changed.                                                                      |
| **`-`** Should be used for values that are directly reflected in the UI.                 | **`-`** Can be used to gain direct access to DOM element access (→ great for reading values or accessing certain browser APIs). |
| **`-`** Should not be used for "behind the scenes" values that have no direct UI impact. |                                                                                                                                 |
